# Welcome to cryp71x3rz CTF solves

Hi, there. This is [cl2y7on1c][1] from [cryp71x3rz][2].


I intend to provide detailed write ups concentrating more on the thought process
that went behind solving the challenge along with the actual solves.

In general most of the CTF writeups lack giving a perspective on how to approach a 
challenge and assumes some amount of pre-exposure to tools and challenges. I would
strive to provide a detailed account to help anyone understand on how to approach
such challenges systematically.

A general heads up, I am more into **crypto** and **reversing**. So you could expect
majority of my writeups concentrating around these types of challenges including some
**miscellaneous** type of challenges.

> Note: This blog does assume that the reader has basic understanding of what a CTF is and intends to develop further from it. For more details on CTF head over to [CTF101][3].

## What is a CTF ?

CTF a.k.a *Capture the Flag* is a competitive hacking challenge. It includes challenges from
a variety of categories including:
1. Miscellaneous
2. Pwn
3. Reversing
4. Forensics
5. Crypto
6. Web vulnerabilities
7. OpenSource Intelligence (OSINT)

The main goal of the challenges is to find hidden flags of the specified format. The format
of the flag is almost always made known in the rules page of competition.

Also almost always the flag is reachable via the clues/files/websites provided as part of the
challenge and does not require any kind of brute force methods to solve them.
