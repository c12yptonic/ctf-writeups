# Welcome to cryp71x3rz CTF solves

Hi, there. This is [cl2y7on1c][1] from [cryp71x3rz][2].


I intend to provide detailed write ups concentrating more on the thought process
that went behind solving the challenge along with the actual solves.

In general most of the CTF writeups lack giving a perspective on how to approach a 
challenge and assumes some amount of pre-exposure to tools and challenges. I would
strive to provide a detailed account to help anyone understand on how to approach
such challenges systematically.

A general heads up, I am more into **crypto** and **reversing**. So you could expect
majority of my writeups concentrating around these types of challenges including some
**miscellaneous** type of challenges.

> Note: This blog does assume that the reader has basic understanding of what a CTF
is and intends to develop further from it. For more details on CTF head over to [CTF101][3].
