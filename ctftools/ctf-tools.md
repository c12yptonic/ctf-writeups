# Tool list
{: .no_toc }

I have made a list of tools that I comprehensively use and some good resources to wrap our heads
around such tools. These tools are in general really useful during the course of a CTF and provides
us with great resources and agility to approach the challenges.  
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

Some of the tools listed would have to be dealt in a very detailed manner which is out of the scope
of this blog. However I would provide a quick intro to get your hands dirty with the tool and also
references to go deep into them.
